This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why did I make this project?
For the game, Animal Crossing. The player has different ways of earning money. One of the most popular ways of earning money in early game was via fishing. 

There are 6 different areas where a player can go and fish, however, different fish will show up during different time. To maximise earnings, the player should only catching the fish that would sell for the most during the time they are playing. 

In game, there's no way of checking the shadow size of the fish and how much they actually sell for. There's also no way of telling what fish is available during the time you are playing. 

This site is created so that players can check and know exactly what fish/insects are available now for catching and how much they sell for. Players can also use this site to keep track of what species they've already caught.
